## Background

**Previous research**

- Housing abandonment can contribute to neighborhood decline 

        Neighborhood Crime | Neighborhood Stability | Housing Market | Unstable Structure | 
        Additional police and fire services.
        
- The impact increases alone with the time of the properties being vacant

- The impact decrease as the distance between Vacant and Non-Vacant increase

        Effective Distance: 250 ft | 500 ft ( Hye-Sung Han, 2013 )



## Why Does It Need Scholarly Attention?

**Baltimore Budget and History**

**Contribution**


## Research Object and Question

- Not only provide the evidence, but provide the reasonable solution to help making decision

- What is the difference between maximize the demolish and minimize the impact

- Distance? Budget? Impact?

- How to efficiently to compute the result in real-time and help make dicision in different period


## Data

- Data Source

## Methodology

- MIP

- Big M

## Result

## Conclusion

- for a fixed function, generally we will get a better percentage of improvment compare to the percentage of the domolish

- both maximization of demo and minimization of impact will slowly converge when the budget increases

- for different budget ( different stage of Urban renewal ), the model will provide a suggestion where to start. **Providing the timeline of Project**
      
      show that when budget increase, the previous solution is contain by the new one
      
- different distance provide the different scale of solution. ex. improve block by block, city block...

- There are many equally good solutions for maximizing the demolish, and actually we can find a best obj function based on each num of demolish
( not going to discuss the equally good sol in minimizing since don't know how to define good here)
