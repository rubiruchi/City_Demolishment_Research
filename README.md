#### Summary & Demo [[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/LennyFan/City_Demolishment_Research/blob/master/WorkLog/%5B01%5DSummary.ipynb)]
   The purpose of project is trying to build a strategic solution of improving the city's vacancy. The simple question of which of the properties were the least expensive to demolish was critical. However, to reflect residents' needs, we are looking for a model which describe the relationship between vacancy and residents and provide a more flexible and reasonable result.
